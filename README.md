# My Projects

In this repository, you will find code and assignment details regard every project that I, Tyler Iles, have worked on. These activities would include:

* An AI that uses Uninfomed and Informed Search Algorithms to Solve a Randomly Generated Maze
* A Simulation Between a Client and a Server Utilizing TCP/IP and UDP Protocols
* An AI that uses Value Iteration to solve a MDP (Markov Decison Process)
* An AI that uses Three Different Kinds of Classification Models to Classify Handwritten Digits Given in the MNIST Dataset.
* An AI that utilizies Neural Networking for regress and classification
* An AI that uses Four Linear Regression Algorithms to Predict the House Prices for Boston homes.

For a more detailed explaination on each of the project, each project will be covered more throughly in this README.

## Maze Search AI

These Python files were what I worked on when I was in my Intro to Artifical Intelligence class. My group and I worked on some of this code together, but the final submission, which is present here, was my individual submission. Our group started working on this project on September 30th, 2021, and I ended up wrapping up the project around October 17th, 2021. A quick note, the Local Search Algorithm was never finished and thus never met assignment expectations, but I chose to share it anyways to demonstrate my fundamental understanding of a local search algorithm, even if that understanding seem rudimentary.

## TCP/IP and UDP Simulation

These files were a part of my Intro to Computer Networks class. In the class we were tasked to simulate a client-server socket utilizing TCP and UDP protocols. The four files were the result. Note that the file name "main.py" is the TCP Server side of the TCP simulation. For more assignment details, see the README in the 
[Server-Client Simulation](tree/main/Server-Client%20Simulation) directory. Also, in case in needs to be iterated, the four .py files and screenshots were put in a .zip before submission.

## Value Iteration AI

The Value Iteration AI was another project I worked on in my Intro to AI class. This was a group submission that was worked on from November 16th, 2021 through December 2nd, 2021. For more details on the assignment, see the pdf within the "Value Iteration AI" directory.

## Classification AI

This AI was worked on while I was in my Introduction to Machine Learning class. It was my job to code an AI that uses Classification algorithms to classify handwritten digits given in the MNIST dataset. I worked on the AI from April 4th, 2022 through April 11th, 2022. For more assignment details and grading, see the Jupyter Notebook with the "classification" directory.

## Nerual Networks AI

This AI was also worked on while I was in my Introduction to Machine Learning class. It was my job to code an AI that uses Neural Networks to enhance classification and regression algorithms. I worked on the AI from May 2nd, 2022 through May 9th, 2022. For more assignment details and grading, see the Jupyter Notebook with the "neural_networks" directory.

## Regression AI

This AI was also worked on while I was in my Introduction to Machine Learning class. It was my job to code an AI that uses Regression algorithms to predict the Housing Price of Boston Homes using a dataset. I worked on the AI from March 7th, 2022 through March 14th, 2022. For more assignment details and grading, see the Jupyter Notebook with the "classification" directory.
