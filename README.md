# My Projects

In this repository, you will find code and assignment details regard every project that I, Tyler Iles, have worked on. These activities would include:

* An AI that uses Uninfomed and Informed Search Algorithms to Solve a Randomly Generated Maze
* A Simulation Between a Client and a Server Utilizing TCP/IP and UDP Protocols
* An AI that uses Value Iteration to solve a MDP (Markov Decison Process)
* An AI that uses Three Different Kinds of Classification Models to Classify Handwritten Digits Given in the MNIST Dataset.
* An AI that utilizies Neural Networking for regress and classification
* An AI that uses Four Linear Regression Algorithms to Predict the House Prices for Boston homes.

For a more detailed explaination on each of the project, each project will be covered more throughly in this README.
