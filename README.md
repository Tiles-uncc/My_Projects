# My Projects

In this repository, you will find code and assignment details regarding every project that I, Tyler Iles, have worked on. These projects include:

* A simulation between a client and a server utilizing TCP/IP and UDP protocols
* A recreation of Pacman
* A platformer game prototype
* A 3D prototype game based on Super Monkey Ball

For a brief description of each of the projects and to guide you, the reader, through the projects, read through the README.

## TCP/IP and UDP Simulation

The files found [here](Server-Client%20Simulation) were a part of my Intro to Computer Networks class. In this assignment, I was tasked to simulate a client-server socket utilizing TCP and UDP protocols. The four Python files were the result. Note that the file name "main.py" is the TCP Server side of the TCP simulation. For more assignment details, see the [README](Server-Client%20Simulation/README.md) in the [Server-Client Simulation](Server-Client%20Simulation) repository. Also, in case it needs to be iterated, the four .py files and screenshots were put in a .zip before submission, although the screenshots will not be found as I decided to not upload them to the GitHub repository.

## Pacman
This is a recreation of Pacman coded in Unity with the help of a YouTube tutorial. The link to the tutorial and game are down below.
