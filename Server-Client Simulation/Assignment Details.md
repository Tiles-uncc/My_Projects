# Assignment objectives: 

* Familiarize yourself with the underlying process of creating the client-server socket.
* Experience the differences between UDP and TCP network applications.  
## Instruction: 

In this project, you are required to design server-client sockets using both UDP and TCP using Python programming language. the following are the requirements:

* The client reads a line of characters (data) from its keyboard and sends lower cased data to the server.
* The server receives the data and converts characters to uppercase.
* The server will print the received data and the converted data on the server-side.
* The client gets modified data and displays the content on its screen
## Deliverables: 

You are required to provide four source code files (TCP client and server, UDP client and server)
Four screenshots (TCP client and server, UDP client and server)
All the files should be compressed into one zip file.
